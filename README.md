# The (Public) Continuous Assessment Database System
**Last Updated: 03/03/2020**

A public-facing, scrubbed version of a project concerning student assessment done by Dr. Kathleen Timmerman and Stephen Bothwell. It will contain code related to the Continuous Assessment Database System (CADS) project detailed in their scholarship and potentially will contain mock data for testing the application.

This description will likely be expanded upon to be a more comprehensive explanation in the near future.

Note that, for the system to function properly, certain files must be added. For example, the database.yml must be added to suit the needs of the given data pipeline.

Moreover, our current system uses Rinruby in such a way that it is required to download R and the following packages separately: svglite, ggplot2, tidyr, magrittr, dplyr, and purrr. We'd like to streamline this process in the future.
